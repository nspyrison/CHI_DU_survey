However, part of my enjoyment may have come from the fact that I was already in isolation. Since returning to campus, Zoom meetings have been harder to do so due to difficulty remaining focused. During COVID-19 isolation, it was possible to remain more focused at home and this resulted in the conference being more enjoyable. I did not, however, that there was some barrier between social interaction. On Zoom, I didn't always know when to speak. It felt too formal as opposed to face-to-face social interaction. In terms of presenting the papers, it worked really well. You could also mute the video and audio and walk out the room without it feeling socially impolite. One thing was that there were no breaks so it was a long time to be sitting. Zoom fatigue was a major issue due to staring at a computer screen for long peroids of time.","Extremely positive","The presentations on Zoom worked very well and the conference did not feel rushed, probably because I was used to Zoom meetings. Social interaction was, however, more difficult because of being unable to read the social dynamics to know when to interact. I feel a barrier between the other people and myself during social events that I would not normally feel. Also, because it was virtual, there were no breaks.
