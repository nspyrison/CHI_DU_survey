Shorter presentation times allowed for staying engaged and it was easier to switch rooms and attend all the talks you wanted without worrying if the room was full. It also provided opportunities to connect with presenters or participants through the chat feature. I think the main difference and advantage of the physical CHI event is that it provides the opportunity to catch up and network with friends &colleagues that are across the world (different timezones and not just regionally) in a more relaxed and sociable manner (over lunch, drinks etc.). I also feel that for some people being away from the actual workplace location allows them to disengage fully from any other regular work duties while the online creates dilemmas around trying to do both and not fully engaging in either.","Somewhat positive","Had very positive experience presenting a paper, attending keynote and other paper sessions.

However, part of my enjoyment may have come from the fact that I was already in isolation. Since returning to campus, Zoom meetings have been harder to do so due to difficulty remaining focused. During COVID-19 isolation, it was possible to remain more focused at home and this resulted in the conference being more enjoyable. I did not, however, that there was some barrier between social interaction. On Zoom, I didn't always know when to speak. It felt too formal as opposed to face-to-face social interaction. In terms of presenting the papers, it worked really well. You could also mute the video and audio and walk out the room without it feeling socially impolite. One thing was that there were no breaks so it was a long time to be sitting. Zoom fatigue was a major issue due to staring at a computer screen for long peroids of time.","Extremely positive","The presentations on Zoom worked very well and the conference did not feel rushed, probably because I was used to Zoom meetings. Social interaction was, however, more difficult because of being unable to read the social dynamics to know when to interact. I feel a barrier between the other people and myself during social events that I would not normally feel. Also, because it was virtual, there were no breaks. Despite these limitations, conferences function very well virtually and it is a suitable alternative to expensive travel and would suggest that it be added as an option for individuals who cannot or do not wish to travel for financial and time reasons.","CHI Down Under was the first international HCI conference I’ve attended","2-5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other (Please specify)","Yes","Asked a presenter or session chair a question","Engaged in informal conversation with other participants or presenters","Listened to the conversations taking place in these rooms",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes","Presenters","Other attendees","Student volunteers","Session chairs",NA,NA,"In Zoom rooms after official sessions had concluded","Via the zoom chat function","During the social event",NA,NA,"Yes","Yes","Not sure",NA,"Hybrid conference, I think for some forms of social interaction, physical connections face to face is necessary.",NA,"Overall, the virtual component worked well for official conference business such as paper presentation.

As an audience member it was easier to hear/follow the q&a through the chat and zoom than it often is at CHI, and seeing others’ questions during the talk sparked thoughts and questions of your own.
